This is a collection of headers for doing numeric computing. It includes many
common numerical and statistical functions. It also binds these functions to
the Lua language using my other project, Lux. The interface between Lua and C++
will hopefully remain consistent.

I was originally planning to just make this a binding of BLAS and LAPACK but it
quickly became swamped by my own attempts at writing these numerical functions.
At some point in the future it will implement those (and more), hopefully for
even more data types than the standards currently support.
